    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 You are responsible for any activity that occurs through your account and you agree you will not sell, transfer, license or assign your account, followers, username, or any account rights.

    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users. You understand that Bunch currently does not conduct criminal background checks or screenings on its users. Bunch also does not inquire into the backgrounds of all of its users or attempt to verify the statements of its users.

You understand and agree that Bunch is not responsible for the Content posted on the Service and you use the Service at your own risk.&nbsp;</p>

    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service for any reason, without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your account by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@trybunch.com">support@trybunch.com</a> and placing “Service Deactivation” in the subject line. Bunch will then take the appropriate steps to terminate your service within 48 hours. If we terminate your access to the Service or you request deactivation of your account, your photos, comments, and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account, but those materials and data may persist and appear within the Service (e.g., on your group pages).</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately cease.</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>) from time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service and at regular intervals. The Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply prospectively to your use of the Service.&nbsp;</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or accounts containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of Use or as reported to us by other Users.</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline. You agree that Bunch is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user and reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users. Specifically, you agree that Bunch is not responsible or liable for any property damage, privacy right or bodily or personal injury caused by any User.</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 The Service, and communications you receive from the Service, may contain links to third-party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or comments within the Service. You understand and acknowledge and agree that Bunch is not responsible or liable for any such third-parties.&nbsp;</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>4</strong> <strong>Rights</strong></p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 As a User, you retain ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. However, by using the Service, you grant to Bunch a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to the Bunch Privacy Policy which describes how you can choose who can view your Content and activities, including your photos.</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Some of the Service may be supported by advertising revenue which may include the display of advertisements and promotions. You hereby agree that Bunch may place such advertising and promotions on the Service or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial communications as such.</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv) you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 The Service contains content owned or licensed by Bunch ("Bunch Content") which is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws. As between you and Bunch, Bunch owns and retains all rights in the Bunch Content and the Service. You agree that you will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Bunch Content and you will not reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Bunch Content.</p>

All page headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade dress of Bunch, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written permission from Bunch.</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 As with any online service, there may be occasions when the Service is interrupted for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment. While Bunch will make all reasonable attempts to restore service in a timely fashion, it does not maintain a backup service for its Users and you agree that you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Bunch will not be liable for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content.&nbsp;</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 Similarly, you acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.&nbsp;</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9 Bunch reserves the right, but is not obligated, to remove any Content from the Service for any reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by Bunch, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 Bunch will not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials other than those specifically requested and to which certain specific terms, conditions and requirements may apply. We do not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and take no responsibility for any materials or ideas so transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions, or other materials, you further agree that Bunch is free to use any such content, information, ideas, or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.</p>

    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>6</strong> <strong>Disclaimer of Warranties</strong></p>
    <p>THE SERVICE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, Bunch CONTENT, IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS. TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, NEITHER Bunch NOR ITS PARENT, SUBSIDIARIES, INVESTORS, AFFILIATES, PARTNERS NOR ANY OF THEIR EMPLOYEES, MANAGERS, OFFICERS OR AGENTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "Bunch PARTIES") MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OR ENDORSEMENTS OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO: (A) THE SERVICE; (B) THE Bunch CONTENT; (C) USER CONTENT; OR (D) SECURITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION TO OR VIA THE SERVICE. IN ADDITION, THE Bunch PARTIES HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, CUSTOM, TRADE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND FREEDOM FROM COMPUTER VIRUS.</p>
    <p>THE Bunch PARTIES DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED; THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE SERVICE OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES THE SERVICE AVAILABLE IS FREE FROM ANY HARMFUL COMPONENTS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, VIRUSES. THE Bunch PARTIES DO NOT MAKE REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT THE INFORMATION (INCLUDING ANY INSTRUCTIONS) ON THE SERVICE IS ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR USEFUL. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS LAWFUL IN ANY PARTICULAR JURISDICTION. THE Bunch PARTIES SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM SUCH WARRANTIES TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER A PARTICULAR JURISDICTION'S LAW AS APPLICABLE TO YOU AND THESE TERMS OF USE.</p>
    <p>THE Bunch PARTIES DO NOT ENDORSE CONTENT AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE (WHETHER ACTUAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHERWISE), INJURY, CLAIM, LIABILITY OR OTHER CAUSE OF ANY KIND OR CHARACTER BASED UPON OR RESULTING FROM ANY CONTENT.</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>7</strong> <strong>Limitation of Liability; Waiver</strong></p>
    <p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE Bunch PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, ECONOMIC, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSSES OR DAMAGES) THAT ARE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RELATED TO: (A) THE SERVICE; (B) THE Bunch CONTENT; (C) USER CONTENT; (D) YOUR USE OF, INABILITY TO USE, OR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICE; (E) ANY ACTION TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH AN INVESTIGATION BY THE Bunch PARTIES OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES REGARDING YOUR OR ANY OTHER PARTY'S USE OF THE SERVICE; (F) ANY ACTION TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH COPYRIGHT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERS; (G) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE SERVICE'S OPERATION; OR (H) ANY DAMAGE TO ANY USER'S COMPUTER, MOBILE DEVICE, OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGE FROM ANY SECURITY BREACH OR FROM ANY VIRUS, BUGS, TAMPERING, FRAUD, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DEFECT, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER LINE OR NETWORK FAILURE OR ANY OTHER TECHNICAL OR OTHER MALFUNCTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE OR EVEN IF THE Bunch PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WHETHER CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY NEGLIGENCE, ACTS OF GOD, TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, OR THEFT OR DESTRUCTION OF THE SERVICE). IN NO EVENT WILL THE Bunch PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT WILL THE Bunch PARTIES TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR CAUSES OR ACTION EXCEED ONE HUNDRED UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($100.00).</p>
    <p>YOU AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT YOU INCUR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES OR INJURIES THAT ARISE OUT OF Bunch'S ACTS OR OMISSIONS, THE DAMAGES, IF ANY, CAUSED TO YOU ARE NOT IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION PREVENTING ANY EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEB SITE, SERVICE, PROPERTY, PRODUCT OR OTHER CONTENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY THE Bunch PARTIES, AND YOU WILL HAVE NO RIGHTS TO ENJOIN OR RESTRAIN THE DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, ADVERTISING, EXHIBITION OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEB SITE, PROPERTY, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR OTHER CONTENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY THE Bunch PARTIES.</p>
    <p>Bunch IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS, CONTENT, INFORMATION, OR DATA OF THIRD PARTIES, AND YOU RELEASE THE Bunch PARTIES, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS FROM ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>8</strong> <strong>Indemnification</strong></p>
    <p>You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at Bunch's request), indemnify and hold the Bunch Parties harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii) your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property damage, privacy right, bodily or personal injury; (iv) your violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or (v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by Bunch in the defense of any claim. Bunch reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of Bunch.</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>9</strong> <strong>Arbitration</strong></p>
    <p>You agree that all disputes between you and Bunch (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with Bunch, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Bunch hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Bunch will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Bunch is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Bunch or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.</p>
    <p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Bunch can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Bunch in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must direct any opt out communication via first class mail to the following:</p>
    <p>Rajah Lehal, </p>
    <p>Cobalt Business Counsel · 330 Bay Street Suite 820 · Toronto, Ontario M5H 2S8 · Canada </p>
    <p><strong></strong></p>
    <p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Bunch account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.</p>
    <p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Bunch.</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>10</strong> <strong>Time Limitation on Claims</strong></p>
    <p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Bunch must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>11</strong> <strong>Governing Law &amp; Venue</strong></p>
    <p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND ARE NOT GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any dispute you have with Bunch exclusively in a state court located in Miami-Dade County, Florida or in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Florida for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.</p>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Failure by Bunch to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. Bunch reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of your relationship with Bunch or the Service.</p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>12</strong> <strong>Entire Agreement</strong></p>
    <p>These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Bunch and, along with the Bunch Privacy Policy, governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements. You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Bunch. Any purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Bunch will be null and void. However, Bunch may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>
    <p><strong></strong></p>
    <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>13</strong> <strong>Territorial Restrictions</strong></p>
    <p>The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject Bunch to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Service or any portion of the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or other feature that we provide.</p>
    <p>Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to United States export controls. Thus, no software from the Service may be downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders. By downloading any software related to the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list.</p>
